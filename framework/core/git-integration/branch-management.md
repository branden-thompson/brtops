# BRTOPS Git Workflow Integration

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Feature Development Branches
```bash
# Standard Pattern
feature/sev-{X}-{feature-name}

# Examples
feature/sev-0-user-authentication    # Critical: User authentication system
feature/sev-1-payment-processing     # High: Payment processing integration  
feature/sev-2-dashboard-ui          # Moderate: User dashboard interface
feature/sev-3-button-styling        # Low: UI button style improvements
feature/sev-4-icon-updates          # Minimal: Icon asset updates
feature/sev-5-typo-fixes            # Trivial: Documentation typo fixes
```

### Documentation Branches
```bash
# Documentation-only changes
docs/sev-{X}-{change-description}

# Examples  
docs/sev-2-api-documentation        # API documentation update
docs/sev-3-user-guide-improvement   # User guide enhancements
docs/sev-5-readme-updates           # README file updates
```

### Hotfix Branches
```bash
# Emergency fixes
hotfix/sev-{X}-{issue-description}

# Examples
hotfix/sev-0-security-vulnerability  # Critical security patch
hotfix/sev-1-data-corruption-fix     # High priority data fix
hotfix/sev-2-login-issue-fix         # Moderate priority login fix
```

### Maintenance Branches
```bash
# Maintenance and cleanup work
maint/{maintenance-type}

# Examples
maint/dependency-updates            # Dependency version updates
maint/code-cleanup                  # Code refactoring and cleanup
maint/performance-optimization      # Performance improvements
maint/security-updates              # Security-related maintenance
```

### Release Branches
```bash
# Release preparation
release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}

# Examples
release/v1.2.0                      # Major feature release
release/v1.1.3                      # Patch release
release/v2.0.0                      # Major version release

## Git Hook Integration

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# BRTOPS pre-commit validation

echo "üéñÔ∏è BRTOPS: Running pre-commit validation..."

# Standard quality checks
echo "Running STD CHECK..."
npm run lint || exit 1

echo "Running BUILD CHECK..."  
npm run build || exit 1

echo "Running TEST CHECK..."
npm test || exit 1

echo "‚úÖ Pre-commit validation passed"
```

### Commit Message Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# BRTOPS commit message validation

commit_msg_file=$1
commit_msg=$(cat $commit_msg_file)

# Check for BRTOPS format
if [[ $commit_msg =~ ^(üéØ GO RCC|üèóÔ∏è GO PLAN|‚ö° GO CODE|‚úÖ GO FINAL|üìä DEBRIEF|üéñÔ∏è|üöÄ|üìù|üîß|üêõ|‚ôªÔ∏è): ]]; then
    echo "‚úÖ BRTOPS commit format validated"
    exit 0
fi

# Allow conventional commits as fallback
if [[ $commit_msg =~ ^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: ]]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Conventional commit format accepted"
    exit 0
fi

echo "‚ùå Commit message must follow BRTOPS or conventional commit format"
echo "Examples:"
echo "  üéØ GO RCC: user-auth - Requirements collection complete"
echo "  ‚ö° GO CODE: payment-system - Core payment processing implemented"
echo "  feat(auth): add user login functionality"
exit 1
```

### Pre-push Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# BRTOPS pre-push quality gates

echo "üéñÔ∏è BRTOPS: Running pre-push quality gates..."

# Get current branch and SEV level
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
sev_level=$(echo $current_branch | grep -o 'sev-[0-5]' | cut -d'-' -f2)

if [ -n "$sev_level" ]; then
    echo "Detected SEV-$sev_level branch, running appropriate quality gates..."
    
    # SEV-0: Maximum gates
    if [ "$sev_level" = "0" ]; then
        echo "Running COV CHECK (100% required)..."
        npm run test:coverage || exit 1
        
        echo "Running SEC SCAN..."
        npm run security:scan || exit 1
        
        echo "Running PERF TEST..."
        npm run test:performance || exit 1
    fi
    
    # SEV-1: Standard gates  
    if [ "$sev_level" = "1" ]; then
        echo "Running COV CHECK (90% required)..."
        npm run test:coverage || exit 1
        
        echo "Running SEC SCAN..."
        npm run security:scan || exit 1
    fi
    
    # SEV-2: Essential gates
    if [ "$sev_level" = "2" ]; then
        echo "Running COV CHECK (80% required)..."
        npm run test:coverage || exit 1
    fi
fi

echo "‚úÖ Pre-push quality gates passed"
```

## Workflow Integration Commands

### CREATE BRANCH Command
```bash
# Creates branch with proper naming and protection
CREATE BRANCH feature SEV-2 dashboard-improvements

# Results in:
# - Branch: feature/sev-2-dashboard-improvements  
# - Protection rules applied based on SEV-2
# - Documentation structure initialized
# - Quality gates configured
```

### COMMIT PHASE Command
```bash
# Structured commit with template
COMMIT PHASE GO_CODE "Dashboard components implemented"

# Results in:
# - Proper BRTOPS commit format
# - Phase-appropriate template used
# - Documentation links included
# - Progress tracking updated
```

### MERGE READY Command
```bash
# Validates merge readiness
MERGE READY

# Checks:
# - All quality gates passed
# - Documentation complete
# - Branch up to date with main
# - SEV-appropriate approvals obtained
```

This git integration ensures that BRTOPS workflow is seamlessly integrated with standard git operations while maintaining quality and documentation standards.
