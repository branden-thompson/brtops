# ORIENT Operation Procedures - BRTOPS v1.1.1

**üõ©Ô∏è BRTOPS Framework Component**  
**Version**: 1.1.1  
**Component**: Context Restoration Engine  
**Classification**: Critical Context Management System

## üéØ ORIENT OPERATION OVERVIEW

The ORIENT command performs comprehensive context restoration and agent re-alignment when context utilization reaches 85% or during agent re-engagement after extended operations, ensuring full situational awareness and optimal performance.

## üìä ORIENT TRIGGER CONDITIONS

### Automatic Triggers
- **Context Utilization ‚â• 85%**: Critical threshold requiring full restoration
- **Post-DEFRAG Operations**: Following context optimization procedures
- **Session Restoration**: Re-engaging after breaks or context switches
- **Performance Degradation**: Detected loss of situational awareness

### Manual Triggers
- **User Command**: `ORIENT` - Immediate context restoration and alignment
- **Phase Transitions**: Before critical BRTOPS phase changes
- **Emergency Realignment**: After context corruption or confusion
- **Long Operation Resume**: Resuming after extended background operations
