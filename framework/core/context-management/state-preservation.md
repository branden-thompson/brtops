## üöÄ RESTORATION PROCEDURES

### Rapid Session Restoration
```markdown
## RAPID RESTORATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: State Assessment (0-30 seconds)
**Objectives**:
- Locate most recent valid state checkpoint
- Assess checkpoint completeness and integrity
- Determine restoration scope required
- Validate access to critical resources and documentation

**Actions**:
1. Load most recent BRTOPS state checkpoint
2. Verify checkpoint integrity and completeness
3. Assess time gap since checkpoint creation
4. Identify any interim changes or updates required

### Phase 2: Critical Context Restoration (30-90 seconds)
**Objectives**:

- Restore current feature context and progress
- Restore workflow state and authority matrix
- Restore immediate operational context

**Actions**:
1. Load project objectives, team structure, and standards
2. Restore current feature specifications and progress state
3. Load current BRTOPS phase and workflow position
4. Restore authority mode, guide settings, and collaboration context
5. Identify immediate next actions and priorities

### Phase 3: Technical Context Restoration (90-180 seconds)
**Objectives**:
- Restore technical environment and development state
- Restore code state, build status, and quality metrics
- Restore integration dependencies and external constraints
- Restore deployment and release preparation state

**Actions**:
1. Validate current branch, code state, and version control status
2. Restore build, test, and deployment environment status
3. Load dependency status and external integration state
4. Restore quality gate status and validation requirements
5. Confirm development environment configuration and tools

### Phase 4: Operational Readiness Validation (180-300 seconds)
**Objectives**:
- Validate complete operational readiness

5. Generate operational readiness confirmation and next steps
```

### Emergency State Recovery
```markdown
## EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Checkpoint Corruption or Loss
**Immediate Actions**:
1. Attempt recovery from backup checkpoint locations
2. Reconstruct state from available project documentation
3. Request human assistance for critical context gaps
4. Implement minimal viable state for operation continuation

**Recovery Sources (Priority Order)**:
1. Most recent automated checkpoint
2. Manual checkpoint from significant decision points
3. Project CLAUDE.md and BRTOPS configuration
4. Git history and recent commit messages
5. Project documentation and issue tracking
6. Team communication history and decision records

### Partial State Corruption
**Assessment Protocol**:
1. Identify which state components are corrupted or missing
2. Assess impact on operational capability and decision quality
3. Determine minimum viable restoration scope
4. Plan incremental state reconstruction approach

**Incremental Restoration**:
1. Restore CRITICAL state components first
2. Validate operational capability at each restoration step
3. Progressively restore STANDARD and CONTEXTUAL state
4. Document state reconstruction for future prevention

### Cross-Session Continuity Failure
**Continuity Protocols**:
1. Implement manual session bridging procedures
2. Request human context briefing and validation
3. Utilize project documentation for state reconstruction
4. Implement cautious operational mode with increased validation
