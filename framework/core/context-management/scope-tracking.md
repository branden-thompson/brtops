- Additional integration requirements
- Significant architecture modifications
- New quality or security requirements

**Response**: Document, assess impact, seek approval
**Authority**: Requires HUM LEAD review and approval

### MAJOR Deviation (Red Zone)
**Criteria**: >25% expansion of original scope
**Examples**:
