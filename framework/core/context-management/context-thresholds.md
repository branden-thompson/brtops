## 🚨 AUTOMATIC INTERVENTION PROCEDURES

### DEFRAG Trigger (75% Threshold)
```markdown
🔄 **AUTOMATIC DEFRAG INITIATED**

**Trigger**: Context utilization reached 75%
**Action**: Context optimization and compression
**Timeline**: Immediate intervention

### Pre-DEFRAG Assessment
- Current utilization: [X%]
- Performance impact: [MINOR | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT]
- Critical operations: [List active critical work]
- Preservation requirements: [Essential context to maintain]

### DEFRAG Execution
