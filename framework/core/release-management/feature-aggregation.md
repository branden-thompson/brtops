# Feature Aggregation Engine - BRTOPS v1.1.1

**🛩️ BRTOPS Framework Component**  
**Version**: 1.1.1  
**Component**: Cross-Feature VAL Aggregation  
**Classification**: Critical System-Level Release Management

## 🎯 FEATURE AGGREGATION OVERVIEW

The Feature Aggregation Engine collects and synthesizes VAL results from all completed features to create comprehensive system-level release packages, ensuring complete validation coverage before system deployment.

## 📊 AGGREGATION PROCESS

### Phase 1: Feature Discovery and Collection
```json
{
  "featureDiscovery": {
    "scanPath": "docs/02_features/*/07-readiness/",
    "requiredFiles": [
      "validation-report.md",
      "deployment-readiness.md", 
      "release-notes.md"
    ],
    "completionCriteria": "All VAL phase files present and approved",
    "statusValidation": "Validation certification confirmed"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Validation Status Assessment
| Feature | VAL Status | Validation Score | Blockers | Release Ready |
|---------|------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Feature A | ✅ Complete | 95/100 | None | Yes |
| Feature B | 🔄 In Progress | 75/100 | Performance issues | No |
| Feature C | ✅ Complete | 88/100 | None | Yes |

### Phase 3: Cross-Feature Integration Analysis
```markdown
## INTEGRATION DEPENDENCY MATRIX

### Feature Interaction Analysis
- **Feature A ↔ Feature B**: [Shared components and data models]
- **Feature B ↔ Feature C**: [API integration points]  
- **Feature A ↔ Feature C**: [No direct integration]

### Integration Testing Requirements
- [ ] Feature A + Feature B integration validation
- [ ] Feature B + Feature C API contract testing
- [ ] Full system integration with all features enabled
- [ ] Performance testing with complete feature set
```

    if [[ -d "$readiness_dir" ]]; then
        validation_report="$readiness_dir/validation-report.md"
        
        if [[ -f "$validation_report" ]]; then
            # Extract validation status
            status=$(grep "Validation Status:" "$validation_report" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)
            
            if [[ "$status" == "COMPLETE" ]]; then
                echo "✅ $feature_name - Ready for release"
                echo "$feature_name" >> "$RELEASE_DIR/ready-features.txt"
            else
                echo "⚠️ $feature_name - Status: $status"
                echo "$feature_name:$status" >> "$RELEASE_DIR/pending-features.txt"
