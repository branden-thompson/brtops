}
```

### AI_LEAD Mode Implementation
```markdown
## AI-LED COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

### Decision Authority Scope
**AI Autonomous Decisions**:
- Technical implementation approaches
- Code structure and organization  
- Testing strategies and methodologies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Documentation structure and content

**Human Oversight Points**:
- Business requirement interpretation
- Stakeholder communication needs
- Security and compliance considerations
- Timeline and resource implications
- Quality standards and acceptance criteria

### Escalation Triggers
```python
def check_escalation_required(decision_context):
    escalation_triggers = [
        decision_context.scope_deviation > 10,
        decision_context.timeline_impact > 20,  # 20% timeline change
        decision_context.resource_impact > 15,  # 15% resource change
        decision_context.security_implications,
        decision_context.compliance_requirements,
        decision_context.stakeholder_impact_high
    ]
    
    return any(escalation_triggers)
```
```

### COLLAB Mode Implementation
```markdown
## COLLABORATIVE DECISION PROTOCOL

### Shared Decision Making Process
1. **Joint Problem Analysis**
   - AI provides technical analysis
   - Human provides business context
   - Shared understanding established
   - Decision criteria agreed upon

2. **Collaborative Solution Development**
   - AI generates technical options
   - Human evaluates business impact
   - Joint refinement of approaches
   - Consensus building on solution

3. **Shared Implementation Planning**
   - AI plans technical implementation
   - Human validates business alignment
   - Joint risk assessment conducted
   - Shared success criteria defined

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
```markdown
### DECISION CONFLICT RESOLUTION

#### Conflict Categories
1. **Technical vs. Business Priority**
   - Resolution: Business priority wins, technical alternatives explored
   - Escalation: Product Owner or Business Stakeholder

2. **Risk Assessment Disagreement**
   - Resolution: Higher risk assessment adopted
   - Escalation: Technical Lead or Risk Management

3. **Resource vs. Quality Trade-off**
   - Resolution: Minimum quality standards maintained
   - Escalation: Project Manager or Executive Sponsor

#### Resolution Process
1. Clearly state the conflict and positions
2. Identify underlying concerns and constraints  
3. Explore alternative solutions addressing both concerns
4. If no consensus, escalate per conflict category
5. Document decision and rationale for future reference
```
```

## ⚡ REAL-TIME AUTHORITY MANAGEMENT

### Dynamic Authority Adjustment
```javascript
class AuthorityManager {
    constructor(projectConfig, teamCapabilities) {
        this.projectConfig = projectConfig;
        this.teamCapabilities = teamCapabilities;
        this.currentAuthority = this.calculateDefaultAuthority();
    }
    
    adjustAuthority(contextFactors) {
        const adjustments = {
            high_risk: () => this.increaseHumanOversight(),
            time_pressure: () => this.enableFasterDecisions(), 
            complex_integration: () => this.requireCollaboration(),
            routine_task: () => this.enableAutonomy(),
            stakeholder_involvement: () => this.requireHumanLead()
        };
        
        contextFactors.forEach(factor => {
            if (adjustments[factor]) {
                adjustments[factor]();
            }
        });
        
        return this.currentAuthority;
    }
    
    validateAuthorityLevel(decision, currentAuthority) {
        const requiredAuthority = this.calculateRequiredAuthority(decision);
        return currentAuthority.level >= requiredAuthority.level;
    }
}
```

### Context-Sensitive Authority Triggers
```markdown
## AUTHORITY ADJUSTMENT TRIGGERS

### Risk-Based Adjustments
- **Security Implications Detected** → Escalate to HUM_LEAD
- **Compliance Requirements** → Require human approval
- **High Financial Impact** → Escalate to stakeholder
- **Customer-Facing Changes** → Require business review

### Complexity-Based Adjustments  
- **Multi-System Integration** → Require COLLAB mode
