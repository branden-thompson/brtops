# BRTOPS v1.0.004-rc Release Notes
*Release Candidate - Command Normalization & Alert System*

**Release Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Status**: Release Candidate  
**Branch**: `1.0.004-rc`  

## üéØ Major Enhancements

### 1. Command Normalization ‚úÖ
**Breaking Change**: Removed "GO" prefix from phase names for cleaner command structure

**Before**:
```
GO RCC, GO PLAN, GO CODE, GO FINAL, GO VAL, GO DEBRIEF
```

**After**:
```
Phase Names: RCC, PLAN, CODE, FINAL, VAL, DEBRIEF
Command Usage: GO RCC, GO PLAN, GO for DEBUG START [issue]
```

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner phase terminology in documentation
- Enhanced "GO for [ACTION]" pattern enables more flexible command usage
- Maintains familiar GO command execution while improving semantic clarity

### 2. Alert System Implementation ‚úÖ
**New Feature**: Three-tier alert system for structured emergency response

#### ALERT-1: Crisis Mode üö®
- **Trigger**: Production down, critical security breach, data loss
- **Protocol**: Halt all non-essential work, exclusive focus on critical problem
- **Features**: Enhanced DEBUG/DOCUMENT/SITREP, mandatory progress reporting

#### ALERT-2: Serious Non-Emergency üü°  
- **Trigger**: Major features broken, significant performance issues
- **Protocol**: Complete current work to stable checkpoint, then refocus
- **Features**: Enhanced protocols with regular progress updates

#### ALERT-3: Minor/Medium Severity üü¢
- **Trigger**: Non-critical bugs, documentation gaps, minor issues
- **Protocol**: Note issue, continue current work, document context
- **Features**: Queue management for future addressing

### 3. Enhanced Debugging Protocols ‚úÖ
**New Feature**: Advanced debugging commands based on real-world AAR lessons

#### ASSESS SCOPE [ISSUE]
- Force explicit scoping before major debugging efforts
- Prevent scope creep through mandatory impact assessment
- Time-boxed checkpoints (2, 4, 6, 8-hour intervals)
- Establish rollback criteria upfront

#### MAP DEPS [SYSTEM]
- Document system dependencies before implementing changes
- Identify core vs. optional vs. external dependencies
- Prevent cascade failures during debugging

#### PROD DEBUG [ISSUE]
- Production-focused debugging with enhanced safeguards
- Mandatory production build environment testing
- Circuit breaker pattern requirements for API fixes

#### GO for DEBUG START [ISSUE]
- Enhanced GO command pattern for targeted debugging sessions
- Integrates with ASSESS SCOPE and MAP DEPS workflows

### 4. Protocol Command Consolidation ‚úÖ
**Enhancement**: OPSCHECK now includes protocol compliance verification

**Before**:
- OPSCHECK (system verification)
- PROTOCOL CHECK (separate command)

**After**:  
- OPSCHECK (comprehensive system + protocol compliance check)
- Consolidated functionality reduces command overhead

## üìö New Documentation

### Core Reference Updates
- **command-reference.md**: Updated with normalized commands and alert system
- **alert-system.md**: Comprehensive alert system documentation with examples
- **enhanced-debugging-protocols.md**: Real-world debugging lessons and frameworks

### Framework Integration
- Enhanced debugging protocols derived from conversation-tracker project AARs
- Time-boxed debugging framework with mandatory checkpoints
- Emergency mode design patterns for graceful degradation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Command Structure Changes
```
# Updated Phase Execution
GO RCC       ‚Üí Requirements & Context Collection
GO PLAN      ‚Üí Strategic Planning & Architecture  
GO CODE      ‚Üí Development & Implementation
GO FINAL     ‚Üí Quality Assurance & Completion
GO VAL       ‚Üí Post-deployment Validation
DEBRIEF      ‚Üí After Action Report

# Enhanced Command Patterns
GO for [ACTION]           ‚Üí Flexible action targeting
ASSESS SCOPE [issue]      ‚Üí Mandatory scoping analysis
MAP DEPS [system]         ‚Üí Dependency documentation
PROD DEBUG [issue]        ‚Üí Production debugging protocols
ALERT-1/2/3 [description] ‚Üí Emergency response activation
```

### Integration Points
- Alert system integrates with existing SITREP and OPSCHECK commands
- Enhanced debugging protocols work with current quality gate system
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing BRTOPS implementations

## üéñÔ∏è Lessons Learned Integration

### From conversation-tracker Surgical Mode Debugging AAR:
1. **Problem Prioritization**: Impact vs. effort matrix prevents disproportionate investment
2. **Production Debugging**: Always test in production build environment  
3. **Time-boxed Framework**: Mandatory checkpoints prevent infinite debugging loops
4. **Root Cause Treatment**: Focus on systemic causes, not just symptoms
5. **Emergency Mode Patterns**: Preserve core functionality during crisis response

### Architecture Decision Framework:
- Progressive vs. nuclear solution assessment
- Dependency mapping before major changes
- Graceful degradation design patterns
- Multi-layer protection architecture

## üîÑ Process Flow Updates
