# BRTOPS Alert System v1.0.004

## Overview

The BRTOPS Alert System provides structured emergency response protocols for development operations. It implements three escalation levels to manage issues based on severity and required response urgency.

## Alert Levels

### ALERT-1: Crisis Mode 🚨
**Classification**: Emergency procedures required
**Trigger**: Production down, critical security breach, data loss, system corruption

**Protocol**:
- ❌ **IMMEDIATE HALT**: All non-essential work stops immediately
- 🎯 **EXCLUSIVE FOCUS**: All resources dedicated to critical problem resolution
- 🔧 **ENHANCED CAPABILITIES**: DEBUG, DOCUMENT, SITREP protocols active
- 📊 **MANDATORY REPORTING**: SITREP required after each major state change
- 🖥️ **PERSISTENT VIEW**: Terminal integration shows active alert status
- ⏰ **TIME-BOXED**: Regular checkpoints to assess progress and escalation

**Usage Examples**:
```
ALERT-1 Production API completely down - all users affected
ALERT-1 Critical security vulnerability being actively exploited
ALERT-1 Database corruption detected - data integrity at risk
```

**Expected AI Response**:
```
🚨 CRISIS MODE ACTIVATED
- Halting all non-essential operations immediately
- Focusing exclusively on: [issue description]
- Enhanced debugging protocols in effect
- Next SITREP scheduled after: [next major action]
```

### ALERT-2: Serious Non-Emergency 🟡
**Classification**: Significant issue requiring focus shift
**Trigger**: Major feature broken, performance degradation, deployment issues

**Protocol**:
- 🛑 **CONTROLLED PAUSE**: Complete current task to stable checkpoint before shifting focus
- 📝 **STATE DOCUMENTATION**: Document current work state comprehensively
- 🔧 **ENHANCED PROTOCOLS**: DEBUG, DOCUMENT, SITREP capabilities activated
- 🎯 **PRIORITY REFOCUS**: Redirect full attention to identified problem
- 📊 **REGULAR REPORTING**: SITREP updates at reasonable intervals

**Usage Examples**:
```
ALERT-2 User authentication failing for 30% of login attempts
ALERT-2 Core feature completely broken in production deployment
ALERT-2 Performance regression causing significant user impact
```

**Expected AI Response**:
```
🟡 SERIOUS ISSUE ACKNOWLEDGED
- Completing current task to stable checkpoint
- Documenting work state before refocus
- Enhanced protocols activated for: [issue description]
- Full attention redirected to issue resolution
```

### ALERT-3: Minor/Medium Severity 🟢
**Classification**: Issue noted for tracking but not immediate action required
**Trigger**: Non-critical bugs, minor performance issues, documentation gaps

**Protocol**:
- 📝 **ISSUE NOTATION**: Record issue details for future addressing
- ✅ **CONTINUE WORK**: Complete current tasks to natural stopping point
- 📚 **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: Document all relevant context before potential context loss
- 🕒 **QUEUE MANAGEMENT**: Add to appropriate work queue for next cycle

**Usage Examples**:
```
ALERT-3 Minor UI alignment issue on mobile devices
ALERT-3 Documentation outdated for recently updated feature
ALERT-3 Console warnings appearing but not affecting functionality
```

**Expected AI Response**:
```
🟢 ISSUE NOTED FOR FUTURE ATTENTION
- Recorded: [issue description]
- Continuing current work to completion
- Context preserved for future resolution
- Queued for next appropriate work cycle
```

## Alert System Integration

### Terminal Integration (Planned)
```
┌─ ALERT-1 ACTIVE ─────────────────────────────┐
│ CRISIS MODE: Production API Failure          │
│ Started: 14:25 PST | Duration: 1h 45m       │
│ Last SITREP: Database connection restored    │
│ Next Action: API service restart validation  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SITREP Enhancement During Alerts
**Standard SITREP**: Basic project status
**Alert-Enhanced SITREP**: 
- Alert level and duration
- Specific issue focus
- Progress since last SITREP
- Next critical action
- Rollback options if applicable

### Command Integration
Alerts integrate with existing BRTOPS commands:

```
ALERT-1 → ASSESS SCOPE → MAP DEPS → PROD DEBUG → SITREP
ALERT-2 → ASSESS SCOPE → Enhanced protocols → Regular SITREP
ALERT-3 → DOCUMENT → QUEUE → Continue normal flow
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Level

**ALERT-1 Criteria**:
- System completely unusable
- Active security threats
- Data loss occurring
- Critical business functionality broken

**ALERT-2 Criteria**:
- Major features degraded but system functional
- Significant user impact but not complete failure
- Deployment issues affecting new releases
- Performance issues causing user complaints

**ALERT-3 Criteria**:
- Minor bugs with workarounds available
- Non-critical UI/UX issues
- Documentation maintenance needed
- Low-priority performance optimizations

### Command Sequences

**Effective Alert Response**:
```
User: "ALERT-1 Database connection pool exhausted"
AI: 🚨 CRISIS MODE ACTIVATED
User: "ASSESS SCOPE database connectivity"
AI: [Scoping analysis]
User: "MAP DEPS database system"  
AI: [Dependency mapping]
User: "PROD DEBUG connection pool issue"
AI: [Production debugging]
User: "SITREP"
AI: [Progress report with next actions]
```

**Avoiding Alert Fatigue**:
- Use ALERT-1 sparingly - only for true emergencies
- Escalate ALERT-3 to ALERT-2 if issue impact increases
- Clear alerts when issues are resolved
- Document lessons learned in DEBRIEF

## Integration with Quality Gates

### Emergency Quality Gate Adjustments

**ALERT-1**: 
- Suspend non-critical quality gates
- Focus on essential functionality verification
- Document deferred quality checks for post-crisis review

**ALERT-2**:
- Maintain essential quality gates
- May defer comprehensive testing until issue resolved
- Ensure no additional regressions introduced

**ALERT-3**:
- Normal quality gate procedures apply
- Use opportunity to enhance quality processes if time permits

## Escalation and De-escalation

### Escalation Triggers
- **ALERT-3 → ALERT-2**: Issue impact increases significantly
- **ALERT-2 → ALERT-1**: Issue becomes critical/emergency status
- **Time-based escalation**: Issues unresolved within expected timeframes

### De-escalation Process
- **ALERT-1 → ALERT-2**: Immediate crisis resolved, but monitoring continues
- **ALERT-2 → ALERT-3**: Major issue resolved, minor cleanup remaining  
- **ALERT-3 → Normal**: Issue fully resolved or properly documented for future

### Resolution Documentation
All alerts should conclude with:
- Issue resolution summary
- Root cause analysis (when appropriate)
- Prevention measures implemented
- Lessons learned documentation
- Process improvements identified
