# BRTOPS Alert System v1.0.004

## Overview

The BRTOPS Alert System provides structured emergency response protocols for development operations. **ALERT represents the global state of work and project** - like a fire alarm that applies to the entire building, not just one room. 

**Key Principle**: ALERT status automatically applies to **ALL CONTEXTS** until explicitly cleared by HUM LEAD using STANDDOWN command. This ensures complete alignment between HUM LEAD and Agent(s) on immediate activity priorities.

## Alert Levels

### ALERT-1: Crisis Mode 🚨
**Classification**: Emergency procedures required  
**Scope**: **GLOBAL** - Applies to all contexts, all work, entire project
**Trigger**: Production down, critical security breach, data loss, system corruption

**Protocol**:
- ❌ **IMMEDIATE HALT**: All non-essential work stops immediately across ALL contexts
- 🎯 **EXCLUSIVE FOCUS**: All resources dedicated to crisis resolution
- 🔧 **ENHANCED CAPABILITIES**: DEBUG, DOCUMENT, SITREP protocols active
- 📊 **MANDATORY REPORTING**: SITREP required after each major state change
- 🖥️ **PERSISTENT VIEW**: Terminal integration shows active alert status
- ⏰ **TIME-BOXED**: Regular checkpoints to assess progress and escalation
- 🌍 **UNIVERSAL APPLICATION**: Status persists across all conversations/sessions until STANDDOWN

**Usage Examples**:
```
HUM LEAD: "ALERT-1"
AI: "🚨 CRISIS MODE ACTIVATED GLOBALLY
    - All non-essential operations halted immediately
    - Enhanced debugging protocols in effect  
    - Awaiting crisis details or immediate instructions
    - Status applies to ALL contexts until STANDDOWN"

HUM LEAD: "Production API completely down"
AI: "🎯 Crisis identified: Production API failure
    - Focusing exclusively on production API restoration
    - Enhanced debugging protocols active
    - Next SITREP after initial assessment"
```

**STANDDOWN/RESCIND Protocol**:
```
# AI Assessment and Prompt
AI: "🎯 Production API fully restored, all systems operational.
    Assessment: Crisis appears to be resolved.
    
    Should I recommend STANDDOWN ALERT-1 to return to normal operations?
    Final decision is yours."

# HUM LEAD Decision
HUM LEAD: "STANDDOWN ALERT-1" (or "RESCIND ALERT-1")
AI: "✅ CRISIS MODE CLEARED
    - Alert-1 status terminated globally
    - Returning to normal operations
    - All contexts restored to pre-crisis state
    - Ready for standard work resumption"
```

### ALERT-2: Serious Non-Emergency 🟡
**Classification**: Significant issue requiring focus shift  
**Scope**: **GLOBAL** - Applies to all contexts, all work, entire project
**Trigger**: Major feature broken, performance degradation, deployment issues

**Protocol**:
- 🛑 **CONTROLLED PAUSE**: Complete current task to stable checkpoint across ALL contexts
- 📝 **STATE DOCUMENTATION**: Document current work state comprehensively
- 🔧 **ENHANCED PROTOCOLS**: DEBUG, DOCUMENT, SITREP capabilities activated
- 🎯 **PRIORITY REFOCUS**: Redirect full attention to identified problem
- 📊 **REGULAR REPORTING**: SITREP updates at reasonable intervals
- 🌍 **UNIVERSAL APPLICATION**: Status persists across all conversations/sessions until STANDDOWN

**Usage Examples**:
```
HUM LEAD: "ALERT-2"
AI: "🟡 SERIOUS ALERT ACTIVATED GLOBALLY
    - Completing current tasks to stable checkpoint
    - Enhanced protocols activating
    - Awaiting issue details for priority refocus
    - Status applies to ALL contexts until STANDDOWN"

HUM LEAD: "User authentication failing for 30% of users"
AI: "🎯 Serious issue identified: Authentication system degradation
    - Documenting current work state
    - Redirecting full attention to auth system
    - Enhanced debugging protocols active"
```

**STANDDOWN Protocol**:
```
HUM LEAD: "STANDDOWN ALERT-2"
AI: "✅ SERIOUS ALERT CLEARED
    - Alert-2 status terminated globally
    - Returning to normal operations
    - All contexts restored to standard priority
    - Ready for regular work resumption"
```

### ALERT-3: Minor/Medium Severity 🟢
**Classification**: Issue noted for tracking but not immediate action required  
**Scope**: **GLOBAL** - Applies to all contexts for awareness and tracking
**Trigger**: Non-critical bugs, minor performance issues, documentation gaps

**Protocol**:
- 📝 **ISSUE NOTATION**: Record issue details for future addressing
- ✅ **CONTINUE WORK**: Complete current tasks to natural stopping point
- 📚 **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: Document all relevant context before potential context loss
- 🕒 **QUEUE MANAGEMENT**: Add to appropriate work queue for next cycle
- 🌍 **UNIVERSAL AWARENESS**: Status noted across all conversations/sessions until STANDDOWN

**Usage Examples**:
```
HUM LEAD: "ALERT-3"
AI: "🟢 MINOR ALERT ACTIVATED GLOBALLY
    - Issue will be noted and tracked
    - Continuing current work to completion
    - Context preservation active
    - Status applies to ALL contexts until STANDDOWN"

HUM LEAD: "Minor UI alignment issue on mobile devices"
AI: "📝 Minor issue noted: Mobile UI alignment
    - Issue recorded for future addressing
    - Continuing current work to natural stopping point
    - Queued for next appropriate work cycle"
```

**STANDDOWN Protocol**:
```
HUM LEAD: "STANDDOWN ALERT-3"
AI: "✅ MINOR ALERT CLEARED
    - Alert-3 status terminated globally
    - Issue tracking complete
    - All contexts returned to normal operations
    - Standard work priority restored"
```

## Alert System Integration

### Terminal Integration (Planned)
```
┌─ ALERT-1 ACTIVE ─────────────────────────────┐
│ CRISIS MODE: Production API Failure          │
│ Started: 14:25 PST | Duration: 1h 45m       │
│ Last SITREP: Database connection restored    │
│ Next Action: API service restart validation  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SITREP Enhancement During Alerts
**Standard SITREP**: Basic project status
**Alert-Enhanced SITREP**: 
- Alert level and duration
- Specific issue focus
- Progress since last SITREP
- Next critical action
- Rollback options if applicable

### Command Integration
Alerts integrate with existing BRTOPS commands:

```
ALERT-1 → ASSESS SCOPE → MAP DEPS → PROD DEBUG → SITREP
ALERT-2 → ASSESS SCOPE → Enhanced protocols → Regular SITREP
ALERT-3 → DOCUMENT → QUEUE → Continue normal flow
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Level

**ALERT-1 Criteria**:
- System completely unusable
- Active security threats
- Data loss occurring
- Critical business functionality broken

**ALERT-2 Criteria**:
- Major features degraded but system functional
- Significant user impact but not complete failure
- Deployment issues affecting new releases
- Performance issues causing user complaints

**ALERT-3 Criteria**:
- Minor bugs with workarounds available
- Non-critical UI/UX issues
- Documentation maintenance needed
- Low-priority performance optimizations

### Command Sequences

**Effective Alert Response**:
```
User: "ALERT-1 Database connection pool exhausted"
AI: 🚨 CRISIS MODE ACTIVATED
User: "ASSESS SCOPE database connectivity"
AI: [Scoping analysis]
User: "MAP DEPS database system"  
AI: [Dependency mapping]
User: "PROD DEBUG connection pool issue"
AI: [Production debugging]
User: "SITREP"
AI: [Progress report with next actions]
```

**Avoiding Alert Fatigue**:
- Use ALERT-1 sparingly - only for true emergencies
- Escalate ALERT-3 to ALERT-2 if issue impact increases
- Clear alerts when issues are resolved
- Document lessons learned in DEBRIEF

## Integration with Quality Gates

### Emergency Quality Gate Adjustments

**ALERT-1**: 
- Suspend non-critical quality gates
- Focus on essential functionality verification
- Document deferred quality checks for post-crisis review

**ALERT-2**:
- Maintain essential quality gates
- May defer comprehensive testing until issue resolved
- Ensure no additional regressions introduced

**ALERT-3**:
- Normal quality gate procedures apply
- Use opportunity to enhance quality processes if time permits

## AI Prompt Authority for STANDDOWN/RESCIND

**AI Assessment Responsibility**: AI Agents should actively assess situation status and prompt HUM LEAD when conditions warrant alert termination:

**When AI Should Prompt**:
- Problem appears to be remediated based on technical assessment
- Bug/issue resolution has been implemented and validated
- System functionality fully restored to operational state
- Situation cleared and normal operations can safely resume

**Prompt Format**:
```
AI: "[Status assessment and evidence of resolution]
    
    Assessment: [Crisis/Issue/Problem] appears to be resolved.
    
    Should I recommend [STANDDOWN/RESCIND] ALERT-[X] to return to normal operations?
    Final decision is yours."
```

**Key Principles**:
- **AI Assesses**: Technical evaluation of problem resolution
- **AI Prompts**: Recommends alert termination when appropriate
- **HUM LEAD Decides**: Always makes final decision on alert status
- **No Autonomous Termination**: AI never terminates alerts without HUM LEAD approval

## Escalation and De-escalation

### Escalation Triggers
- **ALERT-3 → ALERT-2**: Issue impact increases significantly
- **ALERT-2 → ALERT-1**: Issue becomes critical/emergency status
- **Time-based escalation**: Issues unresolved within expected timeframes

### De-escalation Process (with AI Prompt)
- **ALERT-1 → Normal**: AI assesses crisis resolution → Prompts for STANDDOWN → HUM LEAD decides
- **ALERT-2 → Normal**: AI assesses issue resolution → Prompts for RESCIND → HUM LEAD decides  
- **ALERT-3 → Normal**: AI assesses completion → Prompts for STANDDOWN → HUM LEAD decides

### Resolution Documentation
All alerts should conclude with:
- Issue resolution summary
- Root cause analysis (when appropriate)
- Prevention measures implemented
- Lessons learned documentation
- Process improvements identified
